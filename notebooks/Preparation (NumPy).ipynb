    "\n",
    "The programming language of choice for CS5228 is Python. Python is a very popular language that is -- in comparison to other languages -- easy to read, easy to write, and thus easy to learn. Ideally, you already have some hands-on experience with Python from previous modules or simply by working on your own scripts and programs. This course cannot introduce Python to beginners. If needed, however, the popularity of Python resulted in a wider range of excellent tutorials that are freely available online (incl. comprehensive courses on YouTube).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has originally not been designed for \"number crunching\", i.e., numerical computations over large volumes of data. However, its popularity and widespread adoption spurred then development of highly optimized packages. These packages are written in \"fast\" programming languages such as C/C++ and provide bindings to be used in Python programs. One of the most important packages is [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). Directly taken from the website:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fast and versatile, the NumPy vectorization, indexing, and broadcasting concepts are the de-facto standards of array computing today.\n",
    "* NumPy offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more.\n",
    "* NumPy supports a wide range of hardware and computing platforms, and plays well with distributed, GPU, and sparse array libraries.\n",
    "* The core of NumPy is well-optimized C code. Enjoy the flexibility of Python with the speed of compiled code.\n",
    "* NumPy’s high level syntax makes it accessible and productive for programmers from any background or experience level.\n",

    "## Array Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "Array indexing refers to the process of accessing and manipulating elements of an array using various indexing techniques. NumPy provides powerful indexing capabilities that allow you to retrieve specific elements, subsets, or modify values within an array. Array indexing in NumPy can be done using different methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Integer indexing:** Integer indexing allows you to access individual elements or subsets of an array by specifying the indices explicitly. You can use a single integer to access a specific element or use an array of integers to access multiple elements simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Slicing:** Slicing is a common indexing technique that allows you to extract a contiguous portion of an array. It involves specifying a range of indices using the colon (:) symbol. Slicing can be used to retrieve rows, columns, or sub-arrays from a larger array.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Boolean indexing:** Boolean indexing enables you to select elements from an array based on a given condition or a boolean mask. You can create a boolean mask by applying a logical condition to the array, and then use the mask to extract elements that satisfy the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fancy indexing:** Fancy indexing refers to indexing an array using an array of indices or a boolean mask. It allows for advanced indexing operations, such as selecting specific rows or columns in a specific order or combining multiple indexing techniques.\n",
    "\n",

NumPy provides a powerful and efficient mathematical computation framework, allowing you to perform operations on arrays with ease. Array math in NumPy serves several important purposes:\n",

    "* **Efficient computation:** NumPy is built on highly optimized C code, which makes it significantly faster than traditional Python operations on individual elements. Array math in NumPy leverages this efficiency to perform mathematical computations on entire arrays at once. This allows for faster execution and improved performance, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Element-wise operations:** Array math in NumPy applies mathematical operations element-wise, meaning that the operations are performed on corresponding elements of the arrays. This behavior enables convenient and concise syntax for performing mathematical operations on entire arrays without the need for explicit loops. It simplifies the code and improves readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Broadcasting:** NumPy's broadcasting feature allows for implicit expansion of arrays to match sizes and shapes during mathematical operations. This capability allows operations to be performed between arrays of different sizes or dimensions. Broadcasting eliminates the need for explicitly reshaping or replicating arrays, making array math more flexible and convenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Numerical computation:** NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical functions and operators that cover various mathematical operations, including arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, statistical functions, linear algebra operations, and more. These functions enable complex numerical computations and facilitate advanced data analysis and scientific computing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Integration with other libraries:** NumPy serves as the foundation for many scientific computing libraries and frameworks in Python, such as SciPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn. Array math in NumPy allows for seamless integration with these libraries, enabling efficient computation and data manipulation across the entire data science ecosystem.\n",

Therefore, in the last part of the notebook, we go through some concrete use cases to see how NumPy can make our lives easier. The two use cases are still very simple, but should still be able to appreciate that solving using NumPy yields a shorter and cleaner implementation -- in practice, typically also a much faster one, but given the toy data we use here, you won't see a noticeable difference."

    "### Finding the K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) are data points in a dataset that are most similar or closest to a given query point in a feature space. In the k-NN algorithm, the k nearest neighbors are identified based on a distance metric, such as Euclidean distance or cosine similarity. These neighbors play a crucial role in making predictions or determining the similarity of the query point. The k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) problem is a widely used algorithm in machine learning and data mining. It is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression tasks. Some common applications of the k-NN problem include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Classification:** k-NN can be used for classifying data points into different categories. Given a new data point, the algorithm identifies the k nearest neighbors based on a distance metric (such as Euclidean distance) and assigns the class label that is most common among its k nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Regression:** In addition to classification, k-NN can also be used for regression tasks. Instead of assigning class labels, the algorithm estimates the value of a target variable based on the average or weighted average of the target values of its k nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recommender systems:** k-NN can be applied to recommend items to users based on their similarity to other users or items. For example, in collaborative filtering, the algorithm can find similar users and recommend items that those similar users have liked or purchased.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Anomaly detection:** k-NN can be used to identify outliers or anomalies in a dataset. The algorithm measures the distance of a data point to its k nearest neighbors, and if a point is significantly distant from its neighbors, it can be considered as an anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Image recognition:** k-NN can be used in image recognition tasks. Given an input image, the algorithm can compare it with a set of labeled images to determine the class label of the input image based on the labels of its k nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text classification:** k-NN can be applied to classify text documents based on their similarity. By representing documents as vectors, such as using the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) representation, the algorithm can find the k most similar documents and assign a class label based on those neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of the many applications of the k-nearest neighbor problem. Its simplicity and effectiveness make it a popular choice in various fields where pattern recognition and similarity-based analysis are required. For the following example, we create a random dataset `D` of 10 data points, with each data point featuring 5 attributes/features/coordinates. This means that `D` can be represented as a matrix (2d array) of shape `(10, 5)`. We also need a data point `x` for which we want to find the k-nearest neighbors. Naturally, `x` must have the same number of 5 attributes/features/coordinates."

    "### Feature Scaling: Standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature scaling or standardization is an important preprocessing step in data mining and machine learning. It involves transforming the features or variables of a dataset to a common scale or range. Here are the key reasons why feature scaling is important:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Avoiding bias due to different scales:** Features in a dataset often have different scales and units of measurement. For example, one feature might have values ranging from 0 to 100, while another feature could range from 0 to 1000. These differences in scales can introduce bias in certain machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the magnitude of features. Scaling the features ensures that they are on a similar scale, preventing certain features from dominating the learning process solely because of their larger values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Enhancing convergence and performance:** Many optimization algorithms used in machine learning, such as gradient descent, rely on the assumption that features are on a similar scale. When features have vastly different scales, the convergence of these algorithms can be slow or inefficient. By scaling the features, optimization algorithms can converge more quickly, leading to faster and more accurate models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Facilitating distance-based algorithms:** Algorithms that utilize distances or similarities between data points, such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) or clustering algorithms, are sensitive to the scale of features. Without proper scaling, features with larger scales can dominate the distance calculations and influence the results disproportionately. Scaling the features ensures that all features contribute fairly to the distance calculations and allows for more reliable and meaningful comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Improving model performance and interpretation:** Feature scaling can positively impact the performance of various machine learning models. Models such as support vector machines (SVMs), k-NN, and neural networks often benefit from feature scaling, as it aids in finding optimal hyperplanes, improving decision boundaries, and ensuring efficient model training. Furthermore, feature scaling can make the coefficients or weights in linear models more interpretable and comparable, as they represent the importance or contribution of each feature on a common scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common methods of feature scaling include normalization (scaling features to a specific range, e.g., [0, 1]) and standardization (scaling features to have zero mean and unit variance). The choice of scaling method depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the dataset and the machine learning algorithms being used. Overall, feature scaling or standardization is crucial in data mining as it promotes fairness, efficiency, and effectiveness in various machine learning algorithms, improves model performance, and aids in meaningful interpretation of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the purpose of feature scaling, have second look at the formula for calculating the Euclidean distance -- here for just 2 features:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "d(p, q) = \\sqrt{(p_1 - q_1)^2 + (p_2 - q_2)^2 }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the Euclidean Distance depends on the difference between the respective feature values. This can cause a problem if the two features are of very different magnitudes. For example, assume that the values of Feature 1 are around 0.0001 while the values of Feature 2 are around 1,000. That means that the values for Feature 1 will hardly affect the Euclidean Distance between to data points since $(p_1 - q_1)^2$ will always be negligible smalled compared to $(p_2 - q_2)^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature scaling aims to remedy this issue by bringing all features to a common order of magnitude. One approach for feature scaling is **standardization** (scaling features to have zero mean and unit variance). If `x` is a feature and `x_i` is the feature value for data point $i$, each feature value gets standardized by subtracting the feature mean and the feature standard deviation\n",

    "x_i = \\frac{x_i - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how it looks for example. First, we can create another random dataset. In this case, however, we artificially scale up or down the values for the different features. For example, the first feature will be of magnitude 0.01, while the third feature will be of magnitude 100."

    "NumPy is an indispensable package for data analysis and scientific computing with Python, particularly when working with multidimensional arrays, in the simplest case: vectors and matrices. The appropriate use of the built-in methods not only make your code shorter and easier the read, in the very most cases it will make the actual computations much faster. Having a good understanding and grip on the syntax and inner workings is very beneficial in practice...and definitely in this course :).\n",
    "\n",
    "There's of course much more to NumPy. This tutorial gives only a first glimpse to beginners started. Given its popularity and importance, you can find a lot of documentation online (beyond the official documentation on the NumPy website). To conclude, here are just some more take-away comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* NumPy is not the perfect solution for all numerical computations. Most basically, NumPy is most suitable for problems and algorithms that can be expressed as vectorized operations. NumPy is also designed that operations run on a single CPU. With the prevalence of GPU computations, new packages such as [CuPy](https://cupy.dev/) have been developed. It allows users to write high-performance GPU-accelerated code using familiar NumPy syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To keep it simple, most of example in this tutorial were only 2d arrays, i.e., matrices where the notion of \"column\" and \"row\" are meaningful and intuitive. For arrays with more dimensions these notions break down. In general, it's a good practice to always thing in \"first dimension/axis\", \"second dimensions/axis\", \"third dimensions/axis\", etc. Trying to talk about rows and columns in case of multidimensional arrays quickly becomes more confusing than helpful."

    "In the first example use case, we calculated the Euclidean Distances between a single data point `x` and all data points in `D`. This allowed us to use broadcasting to subtract data point `x` from all points in `D`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's assume we have, say, 5 data points `x1`, `x2`, ..., `x5`, and we want to find the k-nearest neighbors for all 5 data points. This requires calculating 50 Euclidean distances, 10 for each `x_i`. Of course, we could simply loop over all `x_i` and perform the steps for each data point as outlined above. However, using loops can significantly affect the runtime for large datasets (not for this small example).\n",
