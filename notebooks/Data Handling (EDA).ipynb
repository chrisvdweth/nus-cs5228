    "# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential step in the data mining process to ensure reliable results, otherwise: *\"garbage in, garbage out\"*. It involves the initial examination and exploration of a dataset to understand its main characteristics, patterns, distributions, and relationships before applying more advanced data mining techniques. The primary goals of EDA in data mining are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Understanding:** EDA helps in gaining a deeper understanding of the dataset by examining its structure, content, and quality. It involves assessing the size of the dataset, the number of features, data types, and the presence of missing or inconsistent values. EDA also involves summarizing and visualizing the data to identify any initial patterns or trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Visualization:** Visualization techniques, such as histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps, are employed in EDA to visually represent the data and reveal its distributional properties, relationships between variables, and potential outliers or anomalies. These visualizations help in identifying patterns, clusters, or trends that may be relevant for subsequent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Descriptive Statistics:** EDA includes computing descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation, to summarize the main characteristics and properties of the dataset. These statistics provide insights into the central tendencies, variabilities, and distributions of the data, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Exploration:** EDA involves exploring different subsets of the data and examining the relationships between variables. This exploration can include identifying correlations, dependencies, or associations between attributes, as well as investigating how different features interact and potentially impact the target variable or outcome of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Preprocessing:** EDA can highlight the need for data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, outliers, or data normalization. By identifying these data quality issues early on, EDA helps guide the appropriate preprocessing techniques required to improve the overall data quality and integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hypothesis Generation:** EDA can generate hypotheses or initial insights about the data that can be further tested and validated using more advanced data mining or statistical techniques. These hypotheses serve as starting points for the subsequent modeling and analysis phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summing up, EDA is all about \"getting to know your data\", a very early crucial phase in the dats mining. In this notebook, we go through some basic steps of an EDA. The dataset and the results are roughly in line with the examples shown in the slides for Lecture 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The EDA generally depends on the type of dataset (e.g., records, transactions, text, images, etc.), the task (clustering, classification, regression, association rule mining, etc), and even the specific algorithm for a given task -- for example, data normalization is typically not required when using Decision Trees compared to, e.g., K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers."

    "The dataset used throughout this notebook is directly taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset). This dataset contains 70,000 records of patient data. Each record contains a series of personal and health related information (e.g., age, weight, height, blood pressure, smoker/non-smoker, etc.) The last attribute `cardio` is binary (`1` or `0`) indicating whether the patient is suffering from a cardiovascular disease. As such, the common task here is to predict if an unknown person is suffering from a cardiovascular disease based on his or her own personal and health information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Side note:** Here we assume that the data was collected from a trusted source like a hospital. In practice, **data provenance**, sometimes called data lineage, is a very important consideration for data mining. It refers to a documented trail that accounts for the origin of a piece of data and where it has moved from to where it is presently. Simply speaking, you want to ensure that all data was recorded and handled to (ideally) guarantee the data not only is of good quality to begin with, but also that it has not been purposefully or unpurposefully tampered with. As a data miner, you more commonly get handed data and not record the data yourself. Hence, we do not focus on data provenance here."

While these are expected weights for babies or toddlers, these values would be very likely to be outliers if we assume that our dataset contains only information about adult patients. Again, it is always important to know as much as possible about the dataset to be analyzed."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plays a crucial role in data mining by enabling analysts to gain insights, understand patterns, and identify trends within a dataset. It involves a set of techniques and visualizations that aid in understanding the structure and characteristics of the data before applying complex modeling or mining algorithms. EDA helps uncover relationships, detect anomalies, and inform feature selection, ultimately leading to more effective data mining processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "During EDA, analysts begin by examining the basic statistical properties of the dataset, such as mean, median, variance, and distribution. Descriptive statistics provide a summary of the central tendency, spread, and shape of the variables, enabling an initial understanding of the data's overall behavior. Graphical visualizations, such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps, are then used to visualize the data distribution, identify outliers, and explore potential associations or correlations between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA also involves investigating the relationship between different variables through techniques like correlation analysis and cross-tabulation. These techniques help assess the strength and direction of relationships, uncover dependencies, and guide feature selection for subsequent modeling tasks. Additionally, EDA may involve dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA) covered in a later notebook, to explore and visualize high-dimensional datasets in a reduced space, facilitating data understanding and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, EDA in data mining often involves data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, data imputation, normalization, and transformation. These steps ensure data quality and reliability, enabling more accurate mining results. We will cover this more in the Data Preprocessing notebook By thoroughly exploring and understanding the data through EDA, analysts can make informed decisions about appropriate data mining techniques, identify potential challenges or limitations, and formulate relevant hypotheses for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exploratory data analysis in data mining is an essential initial step that helps analysts gain insights, identify patterns, and understand the structure of the data. Through descriptive statistics, visualizations, and correlation analysis, EDA provides a foundation for subsequent modeling and mining tasks. By uncovering relationships, detecting outliers, and preprocessing the data, EDA enables more effective and reliable data mining outcomes. The better you know and understand your data, the more likely you can avoid subpar analysis results due to low data quality. How to fix or clean messy data -- if possible to what extent -- is part of data preprocessing (see notebook)."
