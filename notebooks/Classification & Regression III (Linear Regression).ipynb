    "# Classification & Regression: Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression is a statistical modeling technique used to understand and predict the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables, meaning that the dependent variable can be expressed as a linear combination of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear regression, the goal is to find the best-fitting straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the difference between the predicted values and the actual observed values of the dependent variable. This line is determined by estimating the coefficients (or weights) associated with each independent variable. The line's equation in simple linear regression (with one independent variable) can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1*x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $y$ is the dependent variable (the variable we want to predict),\n",
    "* $x$ is the independent variable (the variable used to predict y),\n",
    "* $\\theta_0$ is the y-intercept (the value of y when x is 0),\n",
    "* $\\theta_1$ is the coefficient (the slope of the line, representing the change in y for a unit change in x).\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is considered a linear model because the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is assumed to be linear. It assumes that the change in the dependent variable is a constant multiple of the change in the independent variable(s). Although the actual relationship between the variables in the real world may not be strictly linear, linear regression provides a simple and interpretable approximation that works well in many cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental and popular techniques to solve regression tasks. It's simplicity has several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The best parameter values can be found analytically (in many to most cases)\n",
    "* There are no \"fundamental\" hyperparameters that need tuning. Adding polynomial terms for Polynomial Linear Regression is more on the level of data preprocessing. Different methods for regularization are more inherent to Linear Regression itself\n",
    "* Linear Regression are typically easy to interpret by looking at the coefficients of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether Linear Regression shows (very) good model performance compared to more sophisticated models, typically depends on the nature of the data."

    "The [Howell Dataset](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/blob/master/data/Howell1.csv), also known as the Human Height and Weight dataset, is a dataset often used in machine learning for regression tasks. It is derived from a study conducted by D.G. Howell in 1995, which focused on the relationship between the height and weight of humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of measurements of the height and weight of individuals, along with additional information such as their age and sex. It is notable because it includes data from both children and adults, providing a wide range of age groups. The primary purpose of the Howell dataset is to explore and analyze the relationship between height and weight across different age groups. It allows researchers and machine learning practitioners to build regression models to predict weight based on height or vice versa. Moreover, it can be used to examine how these relationships vary between different age groups or genders.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a widely used machine learning algorithm for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the target variable. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line or hyperplane that minimizes the difference between the predicted values and the actual observed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main advantages of linear regression is its simplicity and interpretability. The algorithm provides coefficients for each independent variable, allowing us to understand the magnitude and direction of their impact on the target variable. This makes it easier to explain and interpret the results of the model. Additionally, linear regression performs well when the underlying relationship between the variables is approximately linear, and it is computationally efficient, making it suitable for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, linear regression has some limitations. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables, which may not hold in all cases. If the relationship is nonlinear, linear regression may not capture it accurately. Additionally, linear regression is sensitive to outliers, as they can heavily influence the line of best fit. Another limitation is that linear regression assumes that the independent variables are not strongly correlated with each other (i.e., no multicollinearity), as this can lead to unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, linear regression is a simple and interpretable algorithm for predicting continuous target variables. Its pros include simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency. However, it has limitations in capturing nonlinear relationships, is sensitive to outliers, and assumes no multicollinearity. Therefore, it is important to assess the assumptions and limitations of linear regression before using it in a particular context."
