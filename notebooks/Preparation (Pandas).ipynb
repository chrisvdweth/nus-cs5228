    "# Preparation: Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "In CS5228, we focus on structured data -- in contrast to unstructured data such as text documents, as well as image, video and audio data. Structured data typically comes in form of a matrix or table with rows representing individual data items and columns the attributes (or features) of a data item. For this kind of table-like data, the [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library represents a versatile and powerful data analysis tool for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pandas` library is a powerful and widely used open-source data manipulation and analysis tool for Python. It provides data structures and functions specifically designed to handle structured data, making it an essential tool for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis. Here are the key purposes and benefits of the pandas package:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tabular data handling:** The primary purpose of pandas is to handle structured data in the form of tables or data frames. It offers the DataFrame data structure, which is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different data types. This allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of structured data, similar to working with spreadsheets or SQL tables. Pandas supports importing and exporting data from various file formats, including CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and more, making it easy to read and write data from different sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data cleaning and preprocessing:** Pandas provides a wide range of functions and methods for data cleaning and preprocessing tasks. It allows for handling missing data, data type conversion, data normalization, deduplication, reshaping, merging, and joining data sets, and much more. These functionalities enable users to transform and clean their data efficiently, ensuring it is in the desired format for subsequent analysis or modeling tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data exploration and analysis:** Pandas offers extensive tools for data exploration, analysis, and manipulation. It provides functionalities for filtering and selecting data, sorting, grouping, aggregating, and summarizing data, performing statistical calculations, computing descriptive statistics, and visualizing data using built-in plotting capabilities. These features enable users to gain insights from their data, discover patterns, and conduct exploratory data analysis, empowering informed decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Integration with other libraries:** Pandas seamlessly integrates with other libraries in the Python ecosystem, such as NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and more. It serves as a bridge between data manipulation and analysis tools, allowing for seamless interoperability. This integration enables users to leverage the functionalities of other libraries alongside pandas, creating a powerful environment for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Efficiency and performance:** Pandas is designed to efficiently handle large datasets and optimize performance. It utilizes vectorized operations and optimized algorithms, implemented in highly efficient C or Cython code, to achieve faster execution times. Additionally, pandas provides various mechanisms for parallelization and optimized memory usage, enabling users to work with large datasets without sacrificing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the pandas package offers a comprehensive set of tools for data manipulation, cleaning, exploration, and analysis. Its tabular data structures, extensive functionality, integration with other libraries, and focus on performance make it a valuable asset for data scientists, analysts, and researchers working with structured data in Python. Pandas simplifies the data processing workflow, accelerates data analysis tasks, and enables efficient data-driven decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, we use the publicly available [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) for the examples."

A common way to create a DataFrame is via reading files, e.g., files with comma-separated (CSV) or tab-separated (TSV) values.\n",

    "The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset used in data mining and machine learning. It provides information about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which famously sank after hitting an iceberg on its maiden voyage in 1912. The dataset is often used for predictive modeling tasks, such as predicting whether a passenger survived or not based on various features. The Titanic dataset typically includes the following information for each passenger:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `PassengerId`: A unique identifier for each passenger.\n",
    "* `Survived`: Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).\n",

    "* `Sex`: The passenger's gender.\n",
    "* `Age`: The passenger's age.\n",

    "* `Cabin`: The cabin number.\n",
    "* `Embarked`: The port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).\n",

    "The goal of analyzing the Titanic dataset is typically to build a model that can predict the survival outcome (survived or not) based on the available features. This involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The dataset is often used to introduce concepts in data mining and machine learning due to its relatively small size and clear target variable.\n",

Particularly for large datasets with many required queries, this can significantly affect the overall performance in a negative way.\n",

    "Pandas is a powerful Python library for data mining. Its purpose is to handle structured data, providing efficient data manipulation and preprocessing capabilities. It simplifies tasks like data cleaning, exploration, and analysis, offering functions for filtering, sorting, grouping, and summarizing data. Pandas seamlessly integrates with other libraries, enabling interoperability and extending its functionality. Its versatility and user-friendly interface make it a go-to tool for extracting insights from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good grasp of the methods provided by pandas can make life very easy as many queries and preprocessing steps can be implemented using very few lines of code. Similar to NumPy -- in fact, Pandas internally relies on NumPy -- the underlying algorithms are not implemented in Python but in C/C++ making the execution typically much faster compared to the runtime of the same algorithms implemented in native Python. This notebook and the EDA notebook cover only a small subset of the feature set of pandas, and it is worthwhile to check the documentation in case for more specific task when handling your own datasets."
